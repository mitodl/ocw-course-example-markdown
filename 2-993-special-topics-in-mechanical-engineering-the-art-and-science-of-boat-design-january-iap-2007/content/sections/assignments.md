This class requires regular attendance and participation in shop work and discussions. Students are not expected to create a successful hull design, but are expected to explore their ideas about hull forms using this design process. Students are expected to bring their preconceptions about boat design and then consider those preconceptions critically using this particular design technology. The class is about boat design technology, rather than simply boat design.

During this one-week class, each student will design and create one wooden half-hull model boat. Then each student will draw up a lines plan representing their completed model, and be able to analyze the structure of their own boat as well as the designs of other students. To see images and video of the hull forms created in this course, see the [image gallery]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/image-gallery) and [video lectures]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/video-lectures).
