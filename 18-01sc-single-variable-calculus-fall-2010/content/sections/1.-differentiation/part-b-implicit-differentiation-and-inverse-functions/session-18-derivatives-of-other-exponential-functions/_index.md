Overview
--------

This session introduces the technique of logarithmic differentiation and uses it to find the derivative of a^x. Substituting different values for a yields formulas for the derivatives of several important functions. Further applications of logarithmic differentiation include verifying the formula for the derivative of x^r, where r is any real number.
