-----------------------------------------------------------

The idea that light is both a wave and a particle is introduced. The properties of waves are described and the applications of diffraction are presented.

[Exploring the Molecular World with X-Ray Diffraction](http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/24154-exploring-the-molecular-world-with-x-ray-diffraction)

Cathy Drennan explains how she and her lab apply the principles of constructive / destructive interference, and other characteristics of light (including energy, frequency, and intensity) in their research using X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional shape of proteins. Cathy’s lab captures “snapshots” of proteins in action with a focus on proteins with medical or energy/environment-related applications.

[Catherine L. Drennan’s Personal Story](http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/24153-catherine-l-drennan-s-personal-story)

Cathy Drennan explains how her dyslexia, and other people’s low expectations of her because of it, have not prevented her from excelling in science and becoming a full professor at MIT. In fact, her “disability” has given her a unique set of visualization skills that allow her to better understand protein shapes and how they fit together.
