Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _5.111 Principles of Chemical Science_ as it was taught by Professor Catherine Drennan, with assistance from Course Coordinator, Allena Mistral Goren, in Fall 2014.

This course provides an introduction to the chemistry of biological, inorganic, and organic molecules. The emphasis is on basic principles of atomic and molecular electronic structure, thermodynamics, acid-base and redox equilibria, chemical kinetics, and catalysis.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Gain a working knowledge of chemical principles that will allow one to take advanced chemistry classes
*   Appreciate how chemistry is used to solve real-world problems
*   Make informed decisions about one's health, environmental and energy issues, and science policy
*   Advance science and engineering through the application of chemical principles
*   Employ chemistry in one's research in a non-chemistry department laboratory
