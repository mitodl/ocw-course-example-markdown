--------------

What is meant by queue discipline?

› _View/hide answer_

Queue discipline is the rule by which we select the next 'customer' to be served. Changing the queue discipline can potentially reduce overall processing time.

What does FIFO stand for?

› _View/hide answer_

First in, first out: for example, standing in line. It is also known as FCFS (first come, first served).

What does LIFO stand for?

› _View/hide answer_

Last in, first out: for example, a stack.

What does SRPT stand for?

› _View/hide answer_

Shortest remaining processing time: this results in the shortest average wait time.
