  <p><span m='860'>In what kind of situations does the Poisson process
  arise?</span> </p><p><span m='4410'>In general, it arises whenever we</span>
  <span m='7240'>have events like arrivals that are somewhat rare,</span> <span
  m='11560'>and which happen in a completely uncoordinated manner,</span> <span
  m='15180'>so that they can show up at any particular time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='18550'>In such situations, the number of arrivals</span> <span
  m='21250'>will be often described by a certain distribution called</span>
  <span m='25480'>the Poisson distribution, and which</span> <span m='27860'>is
  named after the person who first studied this situation,</span> <span
  m='31530'>who is a famous French mathematician</span> <span m='33750'>by the
  name of Simon Denis Poisson.</span> </p><p><span m='37350'>An early example
  where the data seems</span> <span m='39820'>to fit the description of the
  Poisson process</span> <span m='42920'>is a curious one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='44450'>It had to do with deaths from horse</span> <span m='46690'>kicks,
  that is, accidental deaths, in the Prussian army.</span> </p><p><span
  m='51010'>The idea here is that a death by horse kick</span> <span
  m='54110'>can happen pretty much at any time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56410'>And different arrivals, that is, different accidents</span> <span
  m='60200'>are completely uncoordinated from each other.</span> </p><p><span
  m='62760'>So the process is sort of completely random.</span> </p><p><span
  m='66450'>For more scientific applications,</span> <span m='68240'>it was
  realized that certain physical phenomena</span> <span m='71260'>obey the
  Poisson process.</span> </p><p><span m='73410'>Examples are the
  following.</span> </p><p><span m='75590'>You have some radioactive body which
  decays,</span> <span m='80150'>and the decaying happens once in awhile,</span>
  <span m='83660'>emitting various particles.</span> </p><p><span
  m='85880'>Different particles get emitted at completely random times</span>
  <span m='89860'>in a completely uncoordinated manner</span> <span
  m='92390'>and, therefore, this process is actually</span> <span
  m='94460'>described as a Poisson process.</span> </p><p><span
  m='97039'>Conversely, if you have a photo detector who</span> <span
  m='99900'>looks at a very weak light source.</span> </p><p><span m='102710'>So
  photons arrive from that weak light source one at a time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='107030'>And you look at the time at which photons hit the detector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='110810'>Then, the process of photon arrivals</span> <span
  m='112880'>is very well-modeled by the Poisson process.</span> </p><p><span
  m='116560'>For more modern applications, if you</span> <span m='119800'>look
  at the financial markets and the times at which</span> <span
  m='122910'>certain very unexpected events, like certain market shocks,</span>
  <span m='127170'>occur, a model that is commonly employed</span> <span
  m='130160'>is to use a Poisson process model.</span> </p><p><span
  m='133610'>Although this is not an entirely accurate model,</span> <span
  m='137100'>it provides a first approach to situations like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='142030'>But these days, the predominant source</span> <span
  m='144750'>of applications for the Poisson process</span> <span m='147930'>is
  in various service operations.</span> </p><p><span m='151260'>You are the
  phone company.</span> </p><p><span m='152940'>Phone calls get placed at random
  times.</span> </p><p><span m='156746'>And because there are several people
  involved</span> <span m='158620'>who are uncoordinated with each other,</span>
  <span m='160900'>those calls get placed at completely random times.</span>
  </p><p><span m='164870'>And the same story goes about, let's</span> <span
  m='167079'>say, service requests to a web server,</span> <span
  m='170130'>service requests to any kind of company.</span> </p><p><span
  m='173020'>So, many applications that are being studied these days</span>
  <span m='176079'>and which rest on Poisson models involve service
  operations</span> <span m='180540'>of this type.</span> </p>
