  <p><span m='340'>Let us now give an example of a continuous random
  variable--</span> <span m='3530'>the uniform random variable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5320'>It is patterned after the discrete random
  variable.</span> </p><p><span m='8880'>Similar to the discrete case, we will
  have a range of</span> <span m='12110'>possible values.</span> </p><p><span
  m='13290'>In the discrete case, these values would be the integers</span>
  <span m='17370'>between a and b.</span> </p><p><span m='20270'>In the
  continuous case, any real number between a and b</span> <span m='23820'>will
  be possible.</span> </p><p><span m='25370'>In the discrete case, these values
  were equally likely.</span> </p><p><span m='28770'>In the continuous case, at
  all points, we have the same</span> <span m='33000'>height for the probability
  density function.</span> </p><p><span m='35660'>And as a consequence, if we
  take two intervals that have</span> <span m='39710'>the same length, then
  these two intervals will be assigned</span> <span m='44360'>the same
  probability.</span> </p><p><span m='47060'>Intuitively, uniform random
  variables model</span> <span m='49740'>the following situation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='51270'>We know that the numerical value of the random
  variable</span> <span m='54210'>will be between a and b.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56310'>But we know nothing more.</span> </p><p><span m='58000'>We have no
  reason to believe that certain locations are</span> <span m='60940'>more
  likely than others.</span> </p><p><span m='62250'>And in this sense, the
  uniform random variable models a</span> <span m='65120'>situation of complete
  ignorance.</span> </p><p><span m='67700'>By the way, since probabilities must
  add to 1,</span> <span m='71050'>the area of this rectangle must be equal to
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='74960'>And therefore, the height of this rectangle
  has to be 1</span> <span m='79260'>over b minus a, so that we have a height of
  1</span> <span m='83190'>over b minus a.</span> </p><p><span m='84670'>We have
  a length of b minus a.</span> </p><p><span m='86850'>So the product of the
  two, which is the</span> <span m='88660'>area, is equal to 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='91430'>Finally, here's a more general PDF, which</span> <span
  m='94850'>is piecewise constant.</span> </p><p><span m='97440'>One thing to
  notice is that this, in particular, tells us</span> <span m='100820'>that PDFs
  do not have to be continuous functions.</span> </p><p><span m='103670'>They
  can have discontinuities.</span> </p><p><span m='106500'>Of course, for this
  to be a legitimate PDF, the total area</span> <span m='110660'>under the
  curve, which is the sum of the areas of the</span> <span m='114280'>rectangles
  that we have here, must be equal to 1.</span> </p><p><span m='118030'>With a
  piecewise constant PDF, we can calculate probabilities</span> <span
  m='121490'>of events fairly easy.</span> </p><p><span m='123260'>For example,
  if you wish to find the probability of this</span> <span m='126850'>particular
  interval, which is going to be the area under the</span> <span
  m='131130'>curve, that area really consists of two pieces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='135270'>We find the areas of these two rectangles, add them up, and</span>
  <span m='139070'>this gives us the total probability of</span> <span
  m='141440'>this particular interval.</span> </p><p><span m='144240'>So at this
  point, our agenda, moving</span> <span m='146670'>forward, will be
  twofold.</span> </p><p><span m='149170'>First, we will introduce some
  interesting</span> <span m='151550'>continuous random variables.</span>
  </p><p><span m='153810'>We just started with the presentation of the
  uniform</span> <span m='157600'>random variable.</span> </p><p><span
  m='159020'>And then, we will also go over all of the concepts and</span> <span
  m='162910'>results that we have developed for discrete random variables</span>
  <span m='166490'>and develop them again for their continuous
  counterparts.</span> </p><p></p>
