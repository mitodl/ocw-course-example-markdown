Today's economy is global. Companies have divisions located in multiple countries and many depend on networks of buyers and suppliers located throughout the world. How can we hold corporations accountable for good, humane practices when they operate across different legal environments?

Professor Kochan examines these issues in the following video:

Attentiveness Question
----------------------

Which of the following was not a conclusion drawn by MIT researchers led by Richard Locke?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Pressure from NGOs was essential in getting people to focus on the problem of providing decent work.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Codes of conduct and audits were important, but only 50 to 60 percent effective in ensuring compliance.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Management consulting helped suppliers comply with audit measures.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Suppliers in countries with more corrupt governments had greater flexibility and therefore could more readily comply with codes of conduct.&nbsp;

Explanation

Suppliers located in countries that had less corrupt governments scored better on the audit measures.
