Together, this course and its predecessor, [8.05: Quantum Physics II](./resolveuid/4cc828ff9c6e246aa4a08f7c12251ced), cover quantum physics with applications drawn from modern physics. Topics in this course include units, time-independent approximation methods, the structure of one- and two-electron atoms, charged particles in a magnetic field, scattering, and time-dependent perturbation theory. In this second term, students are required to research and write a paper on a topic related to the content of 8.05 and 8.06.
