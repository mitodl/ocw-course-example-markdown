Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _15.S21 Nuts and Bolts of New Ventures/Business Plans_ as it was taught by Joseph Hadzima and Joost Bonsen in IAP 2014.

This course explores the nuts and bolts of preparing a business plan and starting a new venture, and is open to members of the MIT community and to others interested in entrepreneurship. It is particularly recommended for persons who are interested in starting or are involved in a new business or venture. Because some of the speakers are judges of the [MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition](http://www.mit100k.org/#overview), persons who are planning to enter the competition should find the course particularly useful.

January 2014 was the twenty-fifth anniversary of this course.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

For people who have never taken a course in entrepreneurship, the goal is to learn how to go about conceptualizing and starting a company.

For people who are ready to start new ventures, the goal is to give them the set of tools needed to conceptualize their companies and to put their teams together. We want them to catch the entrepreneurial virus!

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

Participants in this course often go on to enter the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition.
