The selected lecture videos in this section are presented with the corresponding slides in a side-by-side / dual window format. The [Lecture Videos]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/lecture-videos) page presents the videos in a standard window format (which may be preferable for smaller screens) with separately downloadable [Lecture Notes]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/lecture-notes).

The benefit of this pop-out player is that you are able view the videos while the slides advance automatically. You can also toggle back and forth using the "Previous page" and "Next page" links below the slide window.

Note: This is a simple player. Once you have toggled between slides or jumped ahead in the video, your last viewed slide will remain on screen until the video has reached another slide queue.
