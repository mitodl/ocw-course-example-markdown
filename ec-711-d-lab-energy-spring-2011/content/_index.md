D-Lab: Energy offers a hands-on, project-based approach that engages students in understanding and addressing the applications of small-scale, sustainable energy technology in developing countries where compact, robust, low-cost systems for generating power are required. Projects may include micro-hydro, solar, or wind turbine generators along with theoretical analysis, design, prototype construction, evaluation and implementation. Students will have the opportunity both to travel to Nicaragua during spring break to identify and implement projects.

D-Lab: Energy is part of MIT's [D-Lab program](http://d-lab.mit.edu/), which fosters the development of appropriate technologies and sustainable solutions within the framework of international development.

This course is an elective subject in MITâ€™s undergraduate [Energy Studies Minor](http://mitei.mit.edu/education/energy-minor/). This Institute-wide program complements the deep expertise obtained in any major with a broad understanding of the interlinked realms of science, technology, and social sciences as they relate to energy and associated environmental challenges.
