### {{< anchor "Assignments" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Pre-Trip Project Work

Project work will ramp up during the next few weeks prior to the spring break trip (Week 8).  Here's what's expected during Weeks 5 to 7.

| PROJECT ASSIGNMENTS | DETAILS | DUE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First brainstorm | Produce annotated pictures from each team member for each project | During Lab 5 class |
| Literature search on topics |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} What exists? How does it function? How is it made? Focus writing on summarize & reflect, not assess — only include sources that pass the assessment {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Reference: "[Annotated Bibliographies](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/01/)," from the Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL). {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Deliverable: ~2 page annotated bibliography per project {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  | End of Week 5 |
| Develop project specifications |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} How: [2.009 Specification lecture slides (PDF)](http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/lectures/15_specifications.pdf) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Example: [2.009 Fruit Spec](http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/lectures/15_fruitSpec/specExamples.html) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Deliverable: specs for each project using 2.009 format (attribute, metric, unit, value)  {{< br >}}It is likely you won't be able to fill in all the values until your trip. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  | End of Week 6, revised by end of Week 7 |
| Second brainstorm | 2 annotated pictures for each project | End of Week 6, revised by end of Week 7 |
| Materials list for trip | Delivered to project partners | End of Week 6 |
| Question list for trip | &nbsp; | During Lecture 7 class |
